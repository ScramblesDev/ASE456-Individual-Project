# Requirements (User Stories) - ver. 2

## User Story 1
As a user who values productivity, I want the ability to manage the duration of my work and break intervals within the Pomodoro app. This customization should be easily accessible, either through a dedicated settings page or a prominent button on the timer interface. By having the option to set my preferred duration, I can tailor the app to match my specific workflow and concentration levels.

## User Story 2
As a use who appreciates being able to see progress, I want to have a progress bar feature to visually track my work and break intervals so that I can easily see how much time is left in my current session and stay motivated to stay on task. The progress bar should accurately reflect the time remaining in the current Pomodoro session or break period.

## User Story 3
As a user who appreciates personalization and aesthetics, I desire the capability to customize the visual theme of the Pomodoro app by selecting my preferred image of a fruit or vegetable. This choice should persist consistently throughout my interaction with the application, from the initial screen to the timer display. Such visual personalization enhances my overall user experience and makes the app feel uniquely mine.

## User Story 4
As a user who relies on auditory cues for time management, I require the Pomodoro app to incorporate audible notifications into its timer functionality. Specifically, I expect the app to emit distinct and pleasant sounds to signal the beginning and end of each work and break interval. These auditory cues should be sufficiently loud to capture my attention without being jarring, contributing to a productive and harmonious work environment.
