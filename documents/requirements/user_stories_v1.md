# Requirements (User Stories) - ver. 1

## User Story 1
As a user, I want to customize the duration of work and break intervals. I would like to set a preferred duration for my timer. This can be through a button, a drop-down, or something similar. I would just like to be able to control it.

# User Story 2
As a user, I want to keep track of my time. I would like a person account to be made, to which it will save my recorded times. I should be able to go back to it, so that upon logging back in, my previous sessions have been logged.

# User Story 3
As a color-sensitive user, I want to make a dark and light mode for the background of my app. This should change the background (and text if needed) accordingly, upon pressing the toggle button.
