# Design Document (ver. 1)

## Overview
This document outlines the design for a simple Pomodoro timer app built using Flutter. The app consists of a single screen with a timer display and buttons to start and reset the timer.

## Components
The app is divided into three main components:
- PomodoroApp: The main application component.
- PomodoroTimer: A StatefulWidget that manages the timer.
- _PomodoroTimerState: The state management for PomodoroTimer.

### PomodoroApp
- Type: StatelessWidget
- Responsibilities:
    - Initialize the app.
    - Define the home screen (PomodoroTimer).

### PomodoroTimer
- Type: StatefulWidget
- Responsibilities:
    - Create an instance of _PomodoroTimerState.

### _PomodoroTimerState
- Type: State<PomodoroTimer>
- Properties:
    - duration: A constant Duration of 25 minutes for the timer.
    - timer: A Timer object to manage the countdown.
    - remaining: A Duration to track the remaining time.
- Methods:
    - startTimer(): Starts the countdown timer.
    - stopTimer(): Stops the timer and resets the remaining time.
    - build(): Builds the UI with a timer display and control buttons.

## User Interface
- Timer Display: Shows the remaining time in minutes and seconds.
- Start Button: Starts the countdown timer.
- Reset Button: Stops the timer and resets it to the initial duration.

## Functionality
- The app displays a timer set to 25 minutes.
- The user can start the timer, which then counts down to zero.
- If the timer reaches zero, it stops automatically.
- The user can reset the timer at any time, which stops the countdown and sets it back to 25 minutes.
